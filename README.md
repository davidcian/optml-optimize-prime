# optml-optimize-prime

We used for this project the GAN architectures and training code from : original gan architectures and training codes from https://github.com/lyeoni/pytorch-mnist-GAN
The code to build the Lookahead optimizers is taken from the official lookahead's paper implementation https://github.com/michaelrzhang/lookahead
We also make use of the implementation of Fr√©chet Inception Distance for PyTorch : https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid
